		Soil testing is the process of analyzing soil samples to determine their nutrient content, pH level, organic matter content, and other important characteristics.

     It is an important tool for farmers, gardeners, and landscapers to help them make informed decisions about what crops or plants to grow and how much fertilizer or other amendments to apply.

Soil testing can also help identify potential problems with soil quality, such as high levels of heavy metals or contaminants, which can affect plant growth and pose a risk to human health if consumed.

By providing information about the specific needs of the soil, soil testing can help reduce the use of fertilizer and other inputs, which can save money and reduce environmental impacts.

Soil testing can be done through a variety of methods, including sending samples to a laboratory for analysis or using a handheld testing kit.

Overall, soil testing is an important practice for anyone who wants to promote healthy plant growth, maximize crop yields, and protect the environment.
